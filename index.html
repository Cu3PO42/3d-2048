<h1><u>User Manual</u></h1>
<p style="line-height:100%">
    <br>The goal of this game is to join all the numbers and reach 2048.</br>
    <br>You move all the squares at once. When two squares with the same number collide,</br>
    <br>they merge into one, producing a square with their values added!</br>
    <br>The game is over when you’re unable to proceed.</br>
</p>
    <br>You begin with two squares. When making a move,</br>
    <br>a new square with a value of either two or four spawns randomly.</br>
    <br>You have two options of moving the squares:</br>
</p>

    <br>1. Left-click:</br>
    <br>Pushes the squares away from the cursor (if possible)</br>

    <br>2. Right-Click:</br>
    <br>Pulls the squares towards the cursor (if possible)</br>
</li>

<p style="line-height:100%">You are able to control your position by using the arrow-keys and the pace with the scrollbar in the lower right corner. </p>

    <br><b><u>Tips:</u></b></br>
    <br><u>1. Don’t rush</u></br>
    <br> In this game time doesn’t have any impact on your score.</br>
    <br> So take your time to think through your moves.</br>
    <br> Keep in mind that every move spawns another number.</br>
    <br><u> 2. Create Rows</u></br>
    <br> You want the big numbers as close as possible.Keep in mind:</br>
    <br> most of the times you still have a chance to bring the numbers together,</br>
    <br> even when they are all over the place.</br>
    <br><u> 3. Anti-Claustrophobic</u></br>
    <br> Empty squares are the be all and end all of the game.</br>
    <br>They can either help you achieve your personal goal….or make your life hell.</br>
    <br>Whilst it makes sense to collect large numbers in one row,</br>
    <br>an empty square in between them could mess with your progress,</br>
    <br> if a new number happens to spawn there.
